                        <p>When we have a passion for something, as long as we never
                           give up we can materialize anything.  Our passion is the ocean
                           and the marine life.  We are always learning something new and
                           greatly enjoy sharing experiences with others.</p>
                        <p>We're dedicated to excellence in service and safety.  Our enjoyment
                           comes from being able to share scuba diving, snorkeling and freediving
                           experinces with all that are interested.
                        <p>It's been a long and hard road to get here but with a lot
                           of hard work and never giving up, we've done it!  There are so
                           many people that have helped along the way. To those that
                           have helped (you know who you are), we are humbled by our
                           lack of human resources in that the most we have to offer in return is
                           our most heartfelt gratitude.  Thank you and see y'all out there on the
                           water!
